<p id="g1"><b>What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</b> <br>
    Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
    
    How does AI work?
    As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
    
    In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.
    
    AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include the following:
    
    Learning. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn it into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.
    Reasoning. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.
    Self-correction. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.
    Creativity. This aspect of AI uses neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, new text, new music and new ideas. </p>

<p id="g2"><b> What Is a Blockchain?</b> <br>
    A <span style="color: red;"> blockchain </span>is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—the term used to describe the inability to be altered.
    
    Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.
    
    Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.
    KEY TAKEAWAYS
    Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.
    Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger. 
    In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control.
    Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
    How Does a Blockchain Work?
    
    You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.</p>

    <p id="g3"><b> what is web 3.0?</b> <br/>

        Web 3.0 represents the next phase of the evolution of the web/internet and potentially could be as disruptive and as big a paradigm shift as Web 2.0 was. Web 3.0 is built upon the core concepts of decentralization, openness, and greater user utility.
        
        Berners-Lee expounded upon some of these key concepts back in the 1990s, as outlined below:
        
        Decentralization: “No permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the web, there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure...and no ‘kill switch’! This also implies freedom from indiscriminate censorship and surveillance.”
        Bottom-up design: “Instead of code being written and controlled by a small group of experts, it was developed in full view of everyone, encouraging maximum participation and experimentation.”
        3
        
        In a 2001 paper, Berners-Lee discussed the concept of what he referred to as the Semantic Web.
